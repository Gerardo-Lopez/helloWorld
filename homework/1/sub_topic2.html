                <p>There are many ideas of what will come of transistor technology. For many decades, Moore’s Law has remained 
                true in that the number of transistors capable of fitting in a dense integrated circuit will double about every 
                two years. But eventually, some say around 2021, we will have reached the maximum capacity with Silicon based solutions. 
                Which leads us to a new all carbon method being developed by an engineer at the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and 
                Computer Science at The University of Texas in Dallas. These carbon nanotubes will use a “spin logic gate” design and 
                will be considering far tinier and more effective than the current high potential of silicon. For more on how they work, please visit this
