                <p>Transistors were created by the three men William Shockley, Walter Houser Brattain, and John Bardeen, 
                pictured above from left to right. </p>
        
                <p>The three were working for Bell Telephone Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey in the mid-1940s and were 
                pursuing an invention to replace the then presently used, vacuum tube technology, which had a similar function 
                to modern transistors.  The problem with these was that they were expensive, used too much power and gave off too much heat. 
                Not to mention that they broke down far too often.</p>
                
                <p>It wasn’t until 1947 that they were able to finally create the first sample of a transistor. The original patent name of 
                the transistor was “Semiconductor Amplifier”. It was a three-electrode circuit element using semi conductive materials. For their 
                revolutionary invention, the three were award the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957, and John Bardeen was awarded the Presidential Medal 
                of Freedom. For more on on the history, please visit this
